# Zeitwork

> deploy any app with a simple `git push`

Zeitwork is a Platform-as-a-Service that automatically builds and deploys your applications from GitHub. Connect your repository, and every commit triggers a new deployment. If your app has a Dockerfile, Zeitwork can run it. **Fully hosted, zero configuration, open source.**

## ‚ú® Features

- **Instant Deployments** - Push to GitHub, see your changes live in seconds
- **Zero Configuration** - Just connect your repo and go - we handle everything
- **Docker-First** - Any app with a Dockerfile can be deployed
- **Fully Managed** - We handle the infrastructure, scaling, and operations
- **Open Source** - Full transparency, no vendor lock-in, fork if you need to
- **Continuous Deployment** - Every commit to your default branch triggers a new build and deploy

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Sign up** for Zeitwork (free tier available)
2. **Connect** your GitHub repository
3. **Push** your code (make sure you have a Dockerfile)
4. **Deploy** automatically - we handle the rest

That's it. No infrastructure to manage, no Kubernetes to learn, no servers to maintain.

## üèóÔ∏è Why Open Source?

Unlike proprietary platforms, Zeitwork gives you:

- **Full Transparency** - See exactly how your apps are deployed
- **Community Driven** - Built in the open, with the community
- **Self-Host Option** - While most use our hosted service, you can run your own if needed

## üéØ Who's it for?

- **Startups** who want superb DX without vendor lock-in
- **Developers** who value transparency and open source
- **Teams** who need a simple, reliable deployment platform
- **Companies** who might need to self-host in the future
